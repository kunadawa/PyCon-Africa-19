    "Data visualization is simply presenting data in graphical or pictorial form which makes the information\n",
    "easy to understand. It helps to explain facts and determine courses of action. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has numerous visualization libraries that come packed with lots of different features. Most of these libraries are general purposed while some are specific to a task. \n",

    "Popular Python libraries for visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Matplotlib: The OG of visualization, most libraries build ontop of it.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Seaborn: High level viz library built ontop of Matplotlib. Offers intuitive and simple interface</li>\n",
    "    <li>ggplot: Based on the popular R ggplot</li>\n",
    "    <li>Plotly: Useful for clean interactive plots. Has online publishing options</li>\n",
    "    <li>Bokeh: Similar to Plotly, great for interactive web-ready plots.</li>\n",
    "    <li>geoplotlib: Great for geographical plotting</li>\n",

    "#### Introduction to Seaborn\n",
    "Seaborn is built on top of Python’s core visualization library Matplotlib. Seaborn comes with some very important features that makes it easy to use. Some of these features are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Visualizing univariate and bivariate data.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Fitting and visualizing linear regression models.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Plotting statistical time series data.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Seaborn works well with NumPy and Pandas data structures</li>\n",
    "    <li>Built in themes for styling Matplotlib graphics</li>\n",
    " </ul>\n",
    "Note: The knowledge of Matplotlib is recommended to tweak Seaborn’s default plots.\n"
